# üí∞ GW2 - Looting Stats

So I was playing some [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/) these days, just collecting stuff I needed to get the [skyscale mount](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale), when I noticed that it's kinda difficult for me to keep track of which items I already have enough of and which ones I still have to farm further.

Thats why I created this little helper script. Thats why I created this little helper script. It's able to read a pre-configured looting-target config (like the sample `skyscale_mount.json`) and can then provide an overview of the current materials/inventory stats for that specific looting-target by utilizing the [GW2 API](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main) to do that.
